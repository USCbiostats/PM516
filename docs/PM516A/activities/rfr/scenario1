# Red Flag Review - Scenario 1

## Background

Dr. Tekenster was studying the effectiveness of administering an epidrual steroid injection to treat back pain. Patients were asked to use the [Numeric Rating Scale](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Numeric_Pain_Rating_Scale) to rate their typical level of back pain. Then, they were administered the injection. The study team contacted them monthly to ask them about their pain ratings up to 6 months post-injection, and again at 9 and 12 months.

## Statistical Approach

The team calculated the difference in the NRS score as (baseline value - follow-up value). At each month, they conducted the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

## Findings

His team concluded the injections reduced pain; all p's were <0.0001.
