# Red Flag Review – Scenario 10

## Background

Dr. Chen was studying whether participation in a test-preparation workshop improves board exam pass rates among medical students.

Data were collected from 400 students across two medical schools (School A and School B). Students chose whether or not to attend the workshop.

Overall, 62% of students who attended the workshop passed the exam, compared to 55% of students who did not attend.

## Statistical Approach

Dr. Chen first compared pass rates overall using a chi-square test.

She then stratified by medical school and found:

- At School A: 78% pass rate among attendees vs 85% among non-attendees.
- At School B: 40% pass rate among attendees vs 45% among non-attendees.

She fit a logistic regression model adjusting for school and reported that workshop participation was associated with lower odds of passing (p = 0.03).

## Findings

Dr. Chen concluded that although the workshop appears beneficial overall, once school is accounted for, the workshop may actually reduce the likelihood of passing.
