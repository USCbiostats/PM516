# Red Flag Review – Scenario 2

## Background

Dr. Ho was studying ways to improve college students' help-seeking attitudes for mental health concerns. He recruited undergraduate students through a web service.

Participants first completed a survey assessing their attitudes toward seeking professional help for a mental health concern using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Extremely Unlikely to 5 = Extremely Likely).

Immediately after completing the baseline survey, participants viewed a brief, 3-minute informational intervention message emphasizing the importance of seeking help and reducing stigma around mental health treatment.

Following the message, participants were asked to complete the same help-seeking attitude measure again.

A total of 719 participants completed both the pre- and post-intervention surveys during a single online session.

## Statistical Approach

Dr. Ho calculated the mean help-seeking score before and after viewing the message. He conducted a paired t-test to compare pre- and post-intervention scores.

## Findings

The mean help-seeking score increased from 3.42 (SD = 0.88) at baseline to 3.55 (SD = 0.90) post-intervention. The paired t-test indicated that this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001).

Dr. Ho and his team concluded that the brief message intervention significantly increased college students’ attitudes toward seeking help for mental health concerns.
