# Red Flag Review - Scenario 2

## Background

Dr. Ho was studying ways to improve college students' help-seeking attitudes. He disseminated a survey to ask about participants' attitudes toward seeking help (a 5-point scale) for a mental health concern.

Then, he showed participants a short, informative intervention message. Afterward, participants were asked again about attitudes toward seeking help. 

A total of 719 participants completed the survey.

## Statistical Approach

Dr. Ho conducted a paired t-test on the data. 

## Findings

His team concluded that the brief message intervention significantly increased attituded toward seeking help.
