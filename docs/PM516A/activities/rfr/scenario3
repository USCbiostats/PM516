# Red Flag Review – Scenario 3

## Background

Dr. Lee was interested in whether a new type of orthopaedic knee surgery led to quicker recovery times compared to the traditional surgical technique. 

He retrospectively reviewed surgical cases performed over the past year at his institution. A total of 28 patients underwent the new procedure. Recovery time was defined as the number of days until the patient was cleared for full weight-bearing without assistive devices.

Most patients had surgery on only one knee. However, two patients underwent bilateral knee surgery during separate procedures within the study period. Dr. Lee included both knees from these two patients in the dataset, yielding a final analytic sample of 30 knees.

Recovery time was recorded separately for each knee.

## Statistical Approach

Dr. Lee summarized recovery time using means and standard deviations. He then conducted a one-sample t-test comparing the observed mean recovery time in his sample (n = 30) to the historical average recovery time for the traditional technique (reported in prior literature).

## Findings

The mean recovery time in the sample was 18.4 days (SD = 4.7), compared to a published historical average of 22 days for the traditional technique. The one-sample t-test indicated that recovery time with the new technique was significantly shorter than the historical benchmark (p = 0.03).

Dr. Lee concluded that the new surgical technique significantly reduces recovery time compared to the traditional approach.
