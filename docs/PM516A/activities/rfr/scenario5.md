# Red Flag Review – Scenario 5

## Background

Dr. Alvarez conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate whether a new anti-inflammatory medication reduces knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis.

A total of 84 participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either the new medication or placebo for 12 weeks.

The primary outcome was change in knee pain score from baseline to 12 weeks, measured on a 0–10 numeric rating scale (higher scores indicate worse pain).

## Statistical Approach

The investigators compared mean change in pain scores between the treatment and placebo groups using a two-sample t-test.

## Findings

The mean reduction in pain was:

- 1.9 points in the treatment group  
- 1.2 points in the placebo group  

The between-group difference in mean change was 0.7 points (95% CI: −0.4 to 1.8; p = 0.21).

The authors concluded that the new medication was no more effective than placebo for reducing knee pain.
