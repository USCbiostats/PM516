# Red Flag Review – Scenario 6

## Background

Dr. Patel was interested in whether consuming jelly beans was associated with acne. She conducted a cross-sectional study among 200 college students.

Participants reported whether they regularly consumed jelly beans of various colors (e.g., red, blue, green, yellow, etc.) and whether they currently had acne.

A total of 20 different jelly bean colors were evaluated separately.

## Statistical Approach

For each jelly bean color, Dr. Patel conducted a chi-square test to assess the association between consumption of that specific color and presence of acne.

## Findings

For 19 of the 20 jelly bean colors tested, there was no statistically significant association with acne (all p > 0.05).

However, consumption of green jelly beans was significantly associated with acne (p = 0.03).

Dr. Patel concluded that green jelly beans are linked to acne.

A university press release highlighted the finding:  
“Green Jelly Beans Linked to Acne — 95% Confidence!”
