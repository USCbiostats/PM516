# Red Flag Review – Scenario 9

## Background

Dr. Lim was examining the association between level of depressive symptoms and performance on a cognitive aptitude test.

He recruited a small pilot sample of 8 individuals from a local clinic. Each participant completed a standardized depression questionnaire and an aptitude test scored from 0 to 100.

## Statistical Approach

Dr. Lim calculated the Spearman rank correlation between depression score and aptitude score.

## Findings

The Spearman correlation was r = 0.65 (p = 0.08).

Dr. Lim was optimistic that the correlation was “quite strong given the small sample size.” He suggested that the relationship may be meaningful despite not reaching statistical significance.
