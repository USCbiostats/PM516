# Week 6

## Statistical Mistakes

This week focuses on common statistical mistakes that can undermine otherwise well-intentioned research. As consultants, part of our role is not only to conduct analyses, but to recognize design flaws, misinterpretations, and analytic shortcuts that can compromise validity.

By the end of this week you will be able to:

1. Identify common statistical mistakes in study design and analysis.
2. Explain why these mistakes threaten analytic validity and propose appropriate remedies.

### Before Class

#### Project Progress

👥 Meet with your group and make progress on the following questions about your project:

* Write a list of the research questions your investigator had. 
* For each item on the list, which variable(s) will you use?
* Group these variables into exposure vs. outcome.

&#x27A4; As you read, think about which of these might arise in the context of your project.

### In Class

In this week's class, we will play 🚩 Red Flag Review 🚩.  Be ready to identify statistical mistakes for several scenarios. For each scenario, your group will identify:

* The primary statistical concern
* Why it threatens analytic validity
* A proposed solution

### Reflection

*How would you respond, in a way that preserves the collaborative relationship, if your client was making one of these mistakes in their analysis?*
