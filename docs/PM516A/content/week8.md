# Week 8

## Project Check-In

This week serves as an analysis checkpoint. Your group will submit a concise draft outlining your research questions and proposed analysis plan. You will receive structured feedback before moving forward with formal modeling and presentation preparation.

By the end of this week you will be able to:

1. Articulate a clear and defensible analysis plan for each research question.
2. Identify potential weaknesses in your proposed approach before formal modeling.

### Before Class

👥 Meet with your group and compile a <u>project draft outline</u>. There should just be one document per group. You may e-mail it or send via Slack. It should include the following:

**Background and Scope**

* List your research questions clearly.
* Identify your outcome and exposure variables.
* Describe the source of the data.

**Data Overview**

* Describe the unit of observation (e.g., participant, procedure, visit, time period) and the total number of observations available.
* Describe the extent of missing data.
* Discuss concerns with any variables (e.g., input errors, unclear coding) and note any data cleaning steps performed.

**Initial Analysis**

* Present summary statistics that describe the main variables (tables or figures), emphasizing their distributions.
* Include simple bivariate analyses that explore the relationships between key variables (e.g., means by group, correlations, contingency tables).

**Proposed Analysis Plan**
 
* For each research question, state the planned statistical approach.
* Specify the null and alternative hypothesis for each test, with regard to your model parameters.

### In Class

This week will be a structured workshop. Each group will briefly present their research questions and proposed analysis plan, and we will discuss strengths, potential weaknesses, and next steps to strengthen your final presentation.

After class, you will complete a brief, confidential check-in regarding group participation and communication. This is intended to ensure equitable contribution and address any concerns early.

### Reflection

*Which aspects of your analysis plan feel most solid, and which feel most uncertain?*
