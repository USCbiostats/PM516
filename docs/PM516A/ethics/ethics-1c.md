# Ethical Scenario 1 (C)

## Scenario

You're performing statistics for Dr. Mapowitz, who is studying the relationship between hormone levels and children’s executive functioning (e.g., their ability to quickly decide which of two food items was healthier). He suspected that a certain hormone was associated with impaired executive functioning (longer time to making a decision). Time to making a decision and hormone levels were both normally distributed and, upon performing a correlation analysis, you found no association (p=0.43). 

## Additional Information

A research assistant on the team told you that the software used to measure reaction time glitched for approximately 20% of the trials, leading to highly variable and sometimes random values. These were not flagged in the data. Another staff member told you, "We didn't bother telling Dr. Mapowitz because we should have caught it early. Now that all the data has been collected, it's going to take a lot of effort and cost to re-run things."

## Questions for Discussion

* How would you respond to this situation?
* What kind of response or resistance would you expect?
* How would you address this resistance?
* How much "ethical risk" does this situation put you in?
* Who wins (benefits) and loses (suffers consequences) if you don't intervene?
