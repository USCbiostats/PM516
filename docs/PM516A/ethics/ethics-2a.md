# Ethical Scenario 2 (A)

## Scenario

Dr. Libra has conducted a study comparing satiety levels from two new drinks versus water. The preliminary manuscript claims that the two drinks make participants feel fuller for longer, in comparison to water. 

Dr. Libra contacts you to review the results of their study and asking you to draft "a quick letter stating that a statistician has reviewed the study and the analysis is appropriate."

## Additional Information

When you ask to see the data to ensure the results are correct, her lab manager sends you a dataset along with the analysis code. You discover that there are clear errors in the analysis. 

When you tell Dr. Libra, she becomes upset and says, "I only asked you to review the methods section. The analysis has already been done and we need to submit this as quickly as possible." 

She also points out that "your website says you provide letters of statistical review. The scope of what I asked for was just the methods -- not a full re-analysis. I think you're overstepping your bounds."

## Questions for Discussion

* How would you respond to this situation?
* What kind of response or resistance would you expect?
* How would you address this resistance?
* How much "ethical risk" does this situation put you in?
* Who wins (benefits) and loses (suffers consequences) if you don't intervene?
