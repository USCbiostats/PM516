# PM516A — Consulting Foundations

## Overview

PM516A introduces the principles and practice of biostatistical consulting.  
This course focuses on developing the communication, analytic judgment, and professional skills necessary to work effectively with non-statistician collaborators.

Students will engage in structured consultation exercises and work in small groups with an investigator on an authentic research problem. The course emphasizes iterative learning — early decisions influence later outcomes, and reflection is central to growth.
