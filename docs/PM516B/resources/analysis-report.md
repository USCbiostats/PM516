# Analysis Report

In this class, instead of creating a presentation for a client, we will be writing an analysis report. The analysis report should consist of at least one table and at least one graphic. Try to keep the report to 5 total pages, though it may be longer. While there are many potential ways to do this, I like to construct my report slightly differently by including:

## Executive Summary
* Before the report, summarize the key points and findings for your client. 
* Make sure the summary has a clear take-home message.
* Write the summary using the ADEPT method (this will be explained later): make sure it is presented in everyday language and is clear to a non-technical audience.
## Background & Goals
* Explain background on why the study was done and any other pertinent background information.
* Describe the scope of the analysis you will be presenting.
## Study Design & Data
* Describe the study design (experimental, cohort, etc.) as it pertains to the analysis you will be performing.
* Explain how the samples were chosen, where the data is from, and anything unusual about the data.
* List the variables you used and any possible manipulations or transformations you have performed.
* Explain any data cleaning you performed, and perhaps a preliminary table or graphic.
## Statistical Methods
* Explain which statistical method you used and why you are using this method to answer the research question.
* Include output that you used to answer the question.
## Results
* Present all results, including estimated values and confidence intervals in addition to p-values.
* Be sure to explain the results in context of the original research question.
* Make a couple tables and/or graphics to convey the results.
* Ensure the subject matter questions have been answered.
