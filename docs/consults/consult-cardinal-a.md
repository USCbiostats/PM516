# Practice Consultation (Cardinal) <br />Particulates in Surgery

## Opening Statement

I’m a doctor involved with dental surgery at USC. We are planning to examine how much particulate matter builds up in our operating room during oral surgery procedures.

Our main goal is to determine whether particulate matter increases in the operating room during these procedures. We plan to use an optical particle counter placed in the room (about 60 cm from the procedure site, on the surgeon's left) to record particulate levels before and during surgery.

Before we collect data, we want to consult with a statistician to make sure our study design and data collection plan are apprpriate and will allow us to answer our research question.

## Additional Information

### Population

* Intended population is all patients undergoing oral surgery.
* Accessible population is patients undergoing oral surgery at USC.
* There are four general categories of surgery procedures, but we were not planning on recording procedure type.
* Different surgeons may perform the procedure.

### Study Structure and Measurements

* Particulate matter will be measured at baseline (before surgery) and repeatedly during surgery.
* We plan to collect measurements every 15 seconds during the procedure.
* Surgery length can range from a few minutes to about 60 minutes.
* The operating rooms have an air filtration system that fully cycles the air every 3-4 minutes.

### Exposure / Intervention

* There is no formal intervention; this is an observational study.
* We are interested in how particulate matter changes naturally during surgery.

### Outcome

* We will measure five particle size categories:
    * <1.0 mcm
    * 1.0-2.5 mcm
    * 2.5-5.0 mcm
    * 5.0-10.0 mcm
    * 10.0-25.0 mcm

### Constraints

* We have limited resources for data management and cleaning.
* We are unsure whether we need to record:
    * Exact surgery duration
    * Time stamps for each particulate measurement
    * Surgeon identity
    * Procedure type


### Thoughts

To be successful, the statisticians must:

* Identify threats to the validity of the proposed design.
* Clarify the appropriate units of analysis.
* Discuss how to handle repeated measurements.
* Account for different surgery lengths, procedure types, and surgeon effects.
* Recommend which varibles must be recorded for valid inference.
* Suggest an overall analysis strategy that the data collection supports.
