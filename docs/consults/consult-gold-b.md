# Practice Consultation (Cardinal) <br />Particulates in Surgery

## Opening Statement

We went ahead and analyzed the data and submitted our results, but the reviewers raised concerns about our statistical approach.

To evaluate the effect of Liposomal versus Standard Bupivacaine, we:
1. Compared pain scores between treatments at each time point
1. Summarized overall pain by computing an AUC-type measure, defined as the sum of pain scores across all time points for each side
1. Compared the summed pain scores between treatment groups

The reviewers said the analysis was “statistically problematic,” but we’re not entirely sure why. The data structure also made the analysis difficult, but we did the best we could.

## Additional Information

Reviewers mentioned:
* "Inflated Type I error"
* "Repeated measures and paired nature of the data are ignored."
* "The AUC metric is incorrectly defined."
* "Treatment assignment is unclear."
* "Missingness is not described or accounted for."
