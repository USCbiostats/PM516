# Practice Consultation 2 <br />Toys and the Times

*Adapted from Taplin 2007*

## Opening Statement

I’m a PhD student studying exposure to violence and childhood development. With the recent events of the past couple years, I’m wondering if the toys that children play with have changed.  
We had parental permission to examine the bedrooms of 100 5-year-old children (50 boys and 50 girls) from the Los Angeles area where we recorded the types of toys that the child played with. We did this in 2015 and again in 2020.  
We want to know if children are playing with different toys nowadays. How do we do this and what kind of statistics do we need to present?


## Debriefing

### Population

Intended: 5-year-old children.  
Actual: 100 5-year-old children (50 boys, 50 girls) from Los Angeles.  

1. <u>How did you recruit these children?</u> To recruit the children, we went into pre-schools in the area and sent out letters to parents that advertised the study. <font color = #ff8c00>*This information could potentially be useful to determine the study design.*</font>

### Intervention

Staff recorded the types of toys in children's bedrooms in 2015 and in 2020.

1. <u>Could you tell me more about how you counted the toys? (e.g., How did you know it was the child's bedroom? What if the child had a sibling? What if the child didn't have a bedroom?)</u> We only counted toys in bedrooms, and only in bedrooms of kids that had their own room (so that we knew the toys were theirs and not, say, a sibling's).
2. <u>What were the different types of toys?</u> The toy types are dolls (e.g., Barbie, GI Joe), construction (e.g., Legos), war toys (e.g., toy guns), role-play (e.g., mini kitchen), cars, and dress-up. <font color = #ff8c00>*The toy types weren't revealed in the opening statement and this information probably should be asked!*</font>
3. <u>Did you record the number of siblings the child had?</u> We did not record this information and we do not know how many siblings each child had. <font color = #ff8c00>*Although the researchers took some precautions, there still could be some effect of having siblings on the number of toys a child has in their bedroom.*</font>

### Comparison

Children in 2015 vs. 2020.

4. <u>Did the same children in 2020 participate in 2015?</u> We recruited children from the same schools in 2015 and 2020. The number of children from each school isn't necessarily the same in 2015 vs. 2020, but I don't have that information with me. <font color = #ff8c00>*If children from completely different schools were chosen in 2020, then it would be difficult to determine whether the effect of time (2020 vs. 2015) was actually due to time or, instead, to just having surveyed participants from different schools than the original ones.*</font>

### Outcome

Types of toys (maybe? TBD).

6. <u>Can you tell me more about the outcome?</u> We don’t know if we want the proportion or the total number of toys analyzed. We just want to know if children are playing with different kinds of toys in 2020 vs. 2015. <font color = #ff8c00>*There may be different ways to analyze this data, and the research question wasn't entirely clear about what the investigator was asking for.*</font>
7. <u>Is the actual toy type/name recorded?</u> We can't categorize the toys beyond what is listed in our data table. For instance, we don't know whether a "doll" is specifically a GI Joe vs. a Barbie.
8. <u>Do you have any information about confounding variables like socioeconomic status (SES)?</u> The socioeconomic status of the students might be written down, but I don't have that information with me. <font color = #ff8c00>*Having additional information about covariates may affect the analysis.*</font>
9. <u>Do you have the data so we can see how it was recorded?</u> We have a data sheet that has the number of children sampled that had a toy of the given type, for each year and sex.

| Group | Dolls | Construction | War Toys | Role-play | Cars | Dress-ups | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 2020 Males | 10 | 20 | 20 | 2 | 25 | 20 |
| 2020 Females | 15 | 2 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 30 |
| 2015 Males | 2 | 10 | 30 | 2 | 30 | 3 |
| 2015 Females | 20 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 0 | 40 |

### Time

2020 vs. 2015

### Thoughts

<font color = #ef0000>I’d suggest constructing a 2x2 table for year-by-toy type (yes vs. no). There would be 6 separate 2x2 tables that you could perform chi-square tests on. The data is stratified by gender, but it’s not clear from the investigator if gender is an effect they want to examine (that would be a great question to ask!).</font>
