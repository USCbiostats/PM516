# Practice Consultation 3 <br />Lunch at HSC

*Adapted from Taplin 2007*

## Opening Statement

I work at the Soto Street Building and only have 60 minutes for my lunch break. Therefore, I need to determine which places give me faster service, and which locations will allow me to return within 60 minutes.  
I typically go to one of three places: 1) the Keck hospital cafeteria, 2) a taco truck on Eastlake, or 3) the Food Court with the Panda Express.  
How can I conduct an experiment to figure out which locations are feasible to eat at? And what pieces of information do I need to record from this experiment?

## Debriefing

### Population

Intended: The "observation" in this case would be the times of lunch breaks.  
Actual: All possible lunch breaks the client could take at these 3 locations.  

1. <u>Do you go to a specific place on a specific day?</u> No, the choice is essentially random. <font color = #ff8c00>*This could get into an effect of day of week which could be important (e.g., on some days lunch may take longer at certain locations than others).*</font>

### Intervention

TBD but probably involving recording how long it takes to have lunch at each of these locations.

2. <u>How do you travel to these locations?</u> I either walk or take the shuttle.
3. <u>How long does it take you to walk to each location?</u> It takes about 15 minutes to talk to any of the locations.
4. <u>How long does it take to take the shuttle to each location?</u> The shuttle takes only 5 minutes each way, but departs every 15 minutes.
5. <u>How long does it typically take to eat at each location?</u> I don't know, but the time it takes for me to eat probably doesn't vary by location.

### Comparison

TBD but probably Keck cafeteria, the taco truck, and the food court.

### Outcome

TBD, but probably the length of time from leaving the desk until returning.

6. <u>Is 60 minutes a hard cut-off or are you allowed to be late occasionally?</u> I'm not sure. Would this affect the analysis? <font color = #ff8c00>*If 60 minutes is a hard cut-off then youâ€™d want to design a method that determines the proportion of trips under 60 minutes vs., say, having the lowest mean time. The standard deviation would be an important piece of information when determining this.*</font>


### Time

NA

7. <u>When do you go to lunch?</u> I suppose I can leave around 11:30 - noonish.

### Thoughts

<font color = #ef0000>There are several possible study designs that might address this question. One possibility is to recruit people to participate in the study - maybe 3-12 people per day who each go to a different location for lunch, and have them repeat this each day for a couple weeks. Then you could build a distribution of the times it would take to eat at each of the places.</font>
