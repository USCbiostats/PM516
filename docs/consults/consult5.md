# Practice Consultation 5 <br />Stress Reduction

## Opening Statement

I’m currently a research assistant in a group that examines the effect of stress on college students. We are looking at ways of reducing stress in these college students and want to see the effect of a couple different types of treatments.  
First, we want to see if there is an effect of Ashwagandha root; this supplement has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety in some medical literature. 
Secondly, we want to see if daily meditation can help reduce stress over the long-term.  
Third, we want to see if a technique called “Day Design” can help these students reduce stress. There is a protocol for this method, which gets the participant to plan their day out in scheduled periods of productivity and relaxation.  
How can we set up an experiment to see if these methods work? We could probably recruit about 60 participants.

## Debriefing

### Population

Intended: College students.  
Actual: TBD.  

1. <u>How will you recruit these participants?</u> We were thinking of recruiting them from psychology classes at USC. Is that bad? <font color = #ff8c00>*College students at USC, and students in psychology classes, might not be representative of all students who will be treated.*</font>

### Intervention

One of three treatment conditions: ASH, MED, DAY. 

2. <u>How will you assign participants to treatment condition?</u> We don't know. Can you help with this?
3. <u>Will participants be assigned to only one condition, or will they receive all conditions (i.e., a cross-over design)?</u> We probably only have enough time and resources to assign each participant to one condition. <font color = #ff8c00>*There are a couple different study designs. This rules out doing a within-subject design (where each participant is administered all treatments).*</font>
4. <u>What if the participants already engage in some of these activities?</u> There's no way to account for other stress reduction techniques the students may be performing on their own. <font color = #ff8c00>*You could make this an exclusion criteria.*</font>
5. <u>Could you tell me about the ASH condition?</u> There are standard supplements the students will be instructed to take daily for 2 weeks.
6. <u>Could you tell me about the MED condition?</u> There is an app the students will install on their device and perform daily 10-minute meditation sessions.
7. <u>Could you tell me about the DAY condition?</u> There is a YouTube video the participants will watch and a daily planner they will write in.
8. <u>What will you do if a participant doesn't adhere to their treatment?</u> Good question. I don't know. What should we do?

### Comparison

Three treatment conditions, no control.  

9. <u>You didn't plan for a control group - why is that?</u> We only have the resources for about 60 participants and adding a control group would make us have about 80... right?
10. <u>You really should have a control group...?</u> Why? The goal is to get participants to reduce their stress levels, so it doesn't make sense to have a group that doesn't receive treatment. <font color = #ff8c00>*A control group would be necessary to ensure that any stress reduction effect was actually due to the treatment and not due to some outside force (e.g., USC implementing free meditation to all students).*</font>

### Outcome

"Stress and anxiety."

11. <u>How will you measure "stress and anxiety"?</u> There is a standardized stress questionnaire we will have the participants take before and after the stress reduction intervention. <font color = #ff8c00>*Since they are not assessing anxiety via an anxiety questionnaire, they will not be able to make a conclusion about students' anxiety.*</font>

### Time

NA

12. <u>How long will participants be followed for?</u> We think that these treatments take about 2 weeks to work, so we want to measure the participants some time after 2 weeks.
13. <u>When in the semester will you measure students (near exams, near a fall/spring break)?</u> We don't know. When do you think the best time to measure them would be? <font color = #ff8c00>*The effect of the intervention may be greater during times of increased stress (e.g., finals week).*</font>


### Thoughts

<font color = #ef0000>There could be several ways to test this. I would verify the sample size is adequate (determined by a power analysis, but we don’t need to get into that) and randomly assign participants to one of four groups: 3 treatments and a control that does not receive any intervention. They should balance demographic characteristics among the groups and the participants should be followed during the same time during the semester.</font>
