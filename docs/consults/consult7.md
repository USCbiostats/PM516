# Practice Consultation 7A <br />Pain Medication in Oral Surgery

## Opening Statement

NOTE: In 7A, only show the "Data" worksheet in the workbook!

We're examining the effects of pain medication on pain after oral surgery. Standard treatment is to prescribe Standard Bupivacaine (SB) to patients recovering from surgery. However, we want to see if Liposomal Bupivacaine (LB) is more effective at reducing pain.</br></br>
We performed this experiment on 30 people who were recovering from molar extractions. Pain medication was administered once through syringe after the surgery. Pain was measured in the evening the day after surgery and administration of pain medication (Day 0), and then again in the evening each subsequent day after surgery (Day 1, Day 2, etc.). </br></br>
Our main question is: are pain scores lower on the side that was treated with Liposomal Bupivacaine vs. the side treated with Standard Bupivacaine? We also want to know if the data is in the right format? If not, how would you make it into the right format?</br></br>

We have our [data set](scenario7data.xlsx) that we can show you. 

IF STUDENTS ASK, THEN YOU CAN TELL THEM:

  * The rows of the data represent time points (tp0 = Day 0, tp1 = Day 1, etc.)
  * The columns of the data indicate which side of the mouth the pain scores correspond to (L# is the left side, R# is the right side)
  * The colors indicate which medication was given. Red (and orange) = Standard Bupivacaine, Green = Liposomal Bupivacaine
  * Some patients are missing data on certain days
