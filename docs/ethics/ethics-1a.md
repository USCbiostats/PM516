# Ethical Scenario 1 (A)

## Scenario

Dr. Mapowitz was studying the relationship between hormone levels and the ability of children’s executive functioning (e.g., their ability to quickly decide which of two food items was healthier). He suspected that a certain hormone was associated with impaired executive functioning (longer time to making a decision). Time to making a decision and hormone levels were both normally distributed and, upon performing a correlation analysis, you found no association (p=0.43). 

## Additional Information

Dr. Mapowitz proceeds to tell you “This result doesn’t make sense. I know there’s an association. Couldn’t you perform another analysis such as a survival analysis since the outcome is time-to-event? I think that's what my postdoc had done before, and I'm not sure why you didn't do it that way."
