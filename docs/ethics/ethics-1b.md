# Ethical Scenario 1 (B)

## Scenario

Dr. Mapowitz was studying the relationship between hormone levels and the ability of children’s executive functioning (e.g., their ability to quickly decide which of two food items was healthier). He suspected that a certain hormone was associated with impaired executive functioning (longer time to making a decision). Time to making a decision and hormone levels were both normally distributed and, upon performing a correlation analysis, you found no association (p=0.43). 

## Additional Information

Dr. Mapowitz reveals to your group that this analysis is a part of a progress report due next week for a major R01 grant. He is worried that, based on these analyses, the grant will not be renewed: "It doesn't have to be statistically significant but we need something suggestive, at least. If we lose this renewal, my staff will be out of a job -- and I don't know if I'll be able to fund your position anymore."
