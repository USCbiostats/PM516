# Ethical Scenario 1 (D)

## Scenario

Dr. Mapowitz was studying the relationship between hormone levels and the ability of children’s executive functioning (e.g., their ability to quickly decide which of two food items was healthier). He suspected that a certain hormone was associated with impaired executive functioning (longer time to making a decision). Time to making a decision and hormone levels were both normally distributed and, upon performing a correlation analysis, you found no association (p=0.43). 

## Additional Information

A doctoral student tells you that, on an earlier pilot (n=12), there was a marginally signficant association (p=0.052). She says, "Dr. Mapowitz has been talking about this result at conferences and in presentations as if it were preliminary confirmation of this effect. I think he is expecting that this effect will be replicated in the full data, and he's going to be very upset if it isn't."
