# Ethical Scenario 2 (B)

## Scenario

Dr. Libra has conducted a study comparing satiety levels from two new drinks versus water. The preliminary manuscript claims that the two drinks make participants feel fuller for longer, in comparison to water. 

Dr. Libra contacts you to review the results of their study and asking you to draft "a quick letter stating that a statistician has reviewed the study and the analysis is appropriate."

## Additional Information

When you ask to see the data, her lab manager sends you an e-mail back saying: "Dr. Libra doesn't want me to send the data out to anybody." 

You explain that this is necessary for your review, and she responds: "I think Dr. Libra doesn't want to include any additional authors on the paper, which is why she doesn't want you to look at the data. I've actually been doing this analysis all alone and Dr. Libra discourages me from asking statisticians to help with the analysis directly."
