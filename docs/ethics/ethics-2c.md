# Ethical Scenario 2 (C)

## Scenario

Dr. Libra has conducted a study comparing satiety levels from two new drinks versus water. The preliminary manuscript claims that the two drinks make participants feel fuller for longer, in comparison to water. 

Dr. Libra contacts you to review the results of their study and asking you to draft "a quick letter stating that a statistician has reviewed the study and the analysis is appropriate."

## Additional Information

When you ask to see the data, her lab manager sends you a dataset along with the analysis code and the IRB application. You discover that the consent forms for the study only mentioned one drink that would be compared to water, and fewer time points than were actually collected.

The lab manager responds that "those changes were made after the study started. The second drink is similar to the first and is harmless, so we figured it wouldn't matter. Plus the data has already been collected so there's nothing we can do now. But please don't mention this to Dr. Libra; she gets stressed out over IRB issues."

## Questions for Discussion

* How would you respond to this situation?
* What kind of response or resistance would you expect?
* How would you address this resistance?
* How much "ethical risk" does this situation put you in?
* Who wins (benefits) and loses (suffers consequences) if you don't intervene?
