# Ethical Scenario 2 (D)

## Scenario

Dr. Libra has conducted a study comparing satiety levels from two new drinks versus water. The preliminary manuscript claims that the two drinks make participants feel fuller for longer, in comparison to water. 

Dr. Libra contacts you to review the results of their study and asking you to draft "a quick letter stating that a statistician has reviewed the study and the analysis is appropriate."

## Additional Information

When you ask to see the data, her lab manager sends you a dataset along with the analysis code. The data set has information about all the participants in the study, including names, e-mails, physical addresses, and birth dates. You express concern but say that you will delete the identifying information and that things should be fine as long as the data is stored securely.

The lab manager says: "Thanks, yeah, this is just how we store the files. We de-identify them before submission. Just ignore the identifiers for now. Also, the data is stored securely, it's on our department's Google drive."
