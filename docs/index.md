# PM516a: Introduction to Biostatistical Consulting (aka Statistical Problem Solving)

## Welcome!
Welcome to PM516a: Introduction to Biostatistical Consulting for Fall 2024! This semester we will learn skills to become an effective consultant and work with an investigator at Keck on an actual research problem.  

This course should be useful for:  

* Students in the MS programs in Biostatistics and Epidemiology who want more practice implementing the skills they have learned in a real-world environment.
* Students in MS or PhD programs who want additional experience tackling an data analysis problem.
* Clinical investigators at USC who want to gain perspective on the biostatistician's role in research.
