# PM516: Biostatistical Consulting (aka Statistical Problem Solving)

## Welcome!
Welcome to PM516: Biostatistical Consulting for Summer 2023! This summer we will be learing skills to become an effective consultant, and working with an investigator at Keck on an actual research problem.  

This course should be useful for:  

* Students in the MS programs in Biostatistics and Epidemiology who want more practice implementing the skills they have learned in a real-world environment.
* Students in MS or PhD programs who want additional experience tackling an data analysis problem.
* Clinical investigators at USC who want to gain perspective on the biostatistician's role in research.

I am currently co-director of the SC-CTSI biostatistics core, and have over 15 years experience with data analysis, research design, and statistical consulting. I'm excited to have you in this course and to help facilitate connections to the broader Keck research community.
