# PM516: Biostatistical Consulting

## Welcome!

PM516 is a two-course sequence designed to prepare students for professional work in biostatistical consulting. The sequence combines structured skill development with authentic, client-facing experience.

Students will learn how to:

* Conduct effective consultations with non-statistician collaborators.
* Translate research questions into defensible analysis plans.
* Communicate statistical findings clearly and responsibly.
* Navigate ethical and professional responsibilities in resarch.

The sequence consists of two 1-unit courses:

**PM516A - Consulting Foundations**

Focuses on communication, analytic judgment, structured role-play, and iterative consultation practice. Students work in small groups with a real investigator and build toward a professional final presentation.

**PM516B - Consulting Practicum**

Provides an independent consulting experience in which each student works directly with a research investigator on an authentic analysis project under faculty supervision.

## Who Should Take This Sequence?

This course series is especially valuable for: 

* MS students in Biostatistics and Epidemiology who want to practice implementing the skills they have learned in a real-world environment.
* Students in MS or PhD programs who want additional experience collaborating with investigators and analyzing data.
* Clinical investigators who want to gain perspective on the biostatistician's role in research.

## How To

This website serves as the central resource for both courses in the sequence.

* PM516A includes weekly content, activities, and structured consultation exercises.
* PM516B outlines practicum requirements, milestones, and deliverables.
