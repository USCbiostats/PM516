# PM516a: Biostatistical Consulting

## Welcome!
Welcome to PM516a: Biostatistical Consulting for Fall 2025! This semester we will learn skills to become an effective consultant and work with an investigator at Keck on an actual research problem.  

This course will be useful for:  

* Students in the MS programs in Biostatistics and Epidemiology who want more practice implementing the skills they have learned in a real-world environment.
* Students in MS or PhD programs who want additional experience tackling an data analysis problem.
* Clinical investigators who want to gain perspective on the biostatistician's role in research.

## How To

This website should be your go-to for information and resources pertaining to this course. The Weekly Content section contains a list of topics for all weeks. Within each given week, there will be a list of activities to complete <u>before class</u>. You do not need to submit these assignments, but they will prepare you for the week ahead and you may/will be required to share your responses in class. Additionally, the <u>in-class</u> activity will be listed, as well as a brief reflection for you to ponder.
