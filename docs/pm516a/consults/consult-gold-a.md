# Practice Consultation (Cardinal) <br />Particulates in Surgery

## Opening Statement

We're examining the effects of pain medication on pain after oral surgery. Standard treatment is to prescribe Standard Bupivacaine (SB) to patients recovering from surgery. However, we want to see if Liposomal Bupivacaine (LB) is more effective at reducing pain.

We are performing this experiment on patients recovering from molar extractions. Pain medication was administered once through syringe after the surgery. Pain was measured in the evening the day after surgery and administration of pain medication (Day 0), and then again in the evening each subsequent day after surgery (Day 1, Day 2, etc.). 

Our main question is: are pain scores lower on the side that was treated with Liposomal Bupivacaine vs. the side treated with Standard Bupivacaine? We also have a data set from a previous study and want to know if the data is in the right format? If not, how would you make it into the right format?

We have our [data set](scenario7data.xlsx) (ONLY SHOW THE "DATA" TAB) that we can show you. 

## Additional Information

### Population

Intended: All patients that undergo molar extractions.  
Actual: Patients that underwent molar extractions at USC.

1. <u>How many patients do you plan to examine?</u> We intend on collecting data from 30 patients. <font color = #ff8c00>*This may be adequately powered but no formal analysis has been done. With a total of 30 participants, it would be a good idea to run such an analysis.*</font>

### Intervention

Liposomal bupivacaine.

1. <u>You mentioned "side of the mouth." Is each patient given both the SB and LB medications, one on each side of the mouth?</u> Yes, each patient received both medications, one on each side of the mouth. <font color = #ff8c00>*This is potentially good study design, as each patient serves as their own control. It also opens us up for a paired-type analysis.*</font>
1. <u>Is SB assigned to the same side of the mouth for each patient?</u> That's what we were going to do, unless you have a different idea. <font color = #ff8c00>*We do not want treatment to be potentially confounded with side of mouth, so treatment should be randomized to left vs. right for each patient.*</font>

### Comparison

Standard bupivacaine.

1. <u>What do you want to compare, exactly?</u> We want to see if, and to what extent, particulates of different sizes increase during these surgeries.

### Outcome

Pain score.

1. <u>Can you tell me more about the outcome?</u> This is the standard Pain NRS (numerical rating scale) metric that is used widely across studies. Patients are asked to rate their pain on a scale of 1-10. <font color = #ff8c00>*Though this is widely used, it has been criticized in the past for individuals having different reference points for pain as well as pain tolerances. The paired design is perfect as it removes the intra-individual variability in pain reference points.*</font>

### Time

Measurements were taken the evening of the day of surgery and each evening thereafter.

1. <u>How many days do you assess follow-up pain?</u> On up to 8 days. <font color = #ff8c00>*This seems like a lot of follow-up but there may be a good reason for it.*</font>
2. <u>You said "up to" 8 days. Are individuals not strictly followed up for 8 days?</u> We just think that, as more time goes on, it will be harder to keep participants engaged. Plus we think that it will make the study less powerful if we see a drop-off in the NRS difference as time goes on. <font color = #ff8c00>*First, you'd want to make sure that the patients who "drop out" are not systematically different than those who remain in the study, or bias could be introduced. Secondly, it seems like they are hedging their bets about the length of follow-up and hoping to not see weakening effects toward the end. That's just bad science; they should pick a meaningful follow-up duration, justify it, and stick to it.*</font>
