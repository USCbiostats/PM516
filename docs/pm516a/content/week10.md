# Week 10

## Presenting Statistical Information

This week focuses on presenting statistical results clearly and honestly. We will evaluate common visualization pitfalls and refine tables and figures from your own projects.

By the end of this week you will be able to:

1. Identify features that distort or obscure statistical information in graphs and tables.
2. Design tables and figures that communicate results clearly and accurately.

### Before Class

#### Project Progress

👥 Meet with your group and make progress on the following questions about your project:

* Draft a table and a figure that you think illustrates an important preliminary descriptive finding.

#### Improving Graphs & Figures

📖 [How to Graph Badly or What Not To Do](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jpboyd/sciviz_1_graphbadly.pdf) (just skim - 15 minutes)

📖 [The Lie Factor and Baseline Paradox](https://nightingaledvs.com/the-lie-factor-and-the-baseline-paradox/) (6 minutes)

📖 [The Lie Factor Definition](https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Lie_Factor) (2 minutes)

&#x27A4; Find an example of a misleading or poorly-designed graph (e.g., https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/). Bring this example to the synchronous class section, ready to explain what makes it problematic.

#### Optimizing Presentation of Results

📖 [Closer Look at Charts vs Tables: The Right Data Visualization](https://ninjatables.com/charts-vs-tables-better-data-visualization/?srsltid=AfmBOop1bgSLZGO_SWROr6jOA4tEX1AXvedS_8_JC4IGymAYZT7xSthm) (7 minutes)

&#x27A4; For your drafted table and figure, explain why each is best presented in that format (or whether it should be changed).

### In Class

In week's class we will critique selected “bad graphs,” discuss common visualization pitfalls, and workshop your project tables and figures.

### Reflection

*What principle will guide your choice between presenting results as text, a table, or a figure?*
