This week you will deliver your final presentation to the investigator. This meeting represents the culmination of your consulting work, including question formulation, analysis, interpretation, and professional communication.

By the end of this week you will be able to:

1. Present statistical findings clearly and professionally to a collaborator.
2. Respond thoughtfully to questions about study design, analysis, and interpretation.

### Complete Before Class

#### Project

👥 Meet with your group to finalize your presentation. As a reminder, here are the following guidelines:

* You will have 25 minutes with your investigator. Plan for a 10-15 minute presentation, leaving sufficient time for your investigator to respond. 
* Clearly address each of the investigator's research questions. Organizing your presentation around these questions may be helpful.
* Each team member must contribute to the presentation.
* Arrive on time and have your webcam on throughout the meeting, as this is a professional consultation.

### Farewell

Congratulations on completing the course. The skills you have developed this semester — communication, analytic judgment, professional responsibility, and ethical awareness — extend well beyond this project.
