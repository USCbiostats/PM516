# Week 2

## Managing the First Consultation

The first consulting meeting sets the tone for a successful collaboration. This week we examine how to structure that meeting, clarify the research question, and manage expectations about time, budget, and statistical limitations.

By the end of this week you will be able to:

1. Use the PICOT framework to clarify a research question.
2. Identify professional considerations such as timelines, scope, and budget, that arise in a first consultation.

### Before Class

#### Understanding the Research Question

A key responsibility of a study biostatistician is translating a researcher's question into a statistically testable hypothesis and analysis plan. Researchers themselves may not always have a fully formed or clearly articulated question. Frameworks such as PICOT can help clarify the components of a research question so that the statistician can structure an appropriate analysis.

&#x27A4; Use a generative AI tool of your choice (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT) to: 

* Generate a hypothetical biostatistical consulting scenario. 
* Identify the primary research question.
* Express the research question using the PICOT framework.
  
&#x27A4; Then, post to Slack:

* Which AI tool you used.
* The research question written in PICOT format.
* One sentence critiquing or refining the AI-generated version (e.g., noting any unclear, unrealistic, or missing components).

#### Consulting Vignettes 

🎥 [Realistic Timelines for Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueF1oe0ct4s)  

* In this video the researcher wanted immediate assistance. What is one thing the consultant did to reassure the researcher?
* If a client came to you with a thesis draft deadline in two days, how would you respond to them?  
* Some statisticians may find it useful to, say, triple the amount of time you think it will take to complete a project, in order to account for unforeseen circumstances. What considerations may be needed for deciding on a reasonable time frame?  

🎥 [Beginning and Ending A Meeting Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3l1DEXoXRM)  

* What did the consultant say was the most important goal in a first meeting? 
* Why did the consultant wrap up the discussion 10 minutes before the end of the scheduled time slot?
* What is one pitfall that could occur if the statistician gave the client specific statistical advice during this first meeting?

🎥 [Using Statistical Results to Identify Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upkMfMF0k2k)  

* List 3 things you think the client should have known before entering this consultation.  
* Given your current or hypothetical future position, would you take on a project like this knowing the grant proposal did not have a budget for statistical consulting/collaboration?  
* The researcher believed that “statistical magic” could be used to determine which variables are the most important. What challenges could arise from this view? What might you do to discuss this topic with potential clients?
