# Week 5

## Investigator Meeting

This week you will conduct a live consultation with the investigator. Your ability to ask clear, structured questions will determine how effectively you can translate the research question into a statistical analysis plan.

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Conduct a professional consultation with a real investigator.
2. Clarify the study question and identify next steps for statistical analysis.

### Before Class

📖 [What to Ask During A Consultation](../resources/what-to-ask.md)  (5 minutes)

&#x27A4; Come prepared with at least three questions you anticipate asking the investigator.

### In Class

This week's meeting will set the direction for your group's project, and the clarity of your questions will determine the quality of the analysis plan. 

Because this is a professional consultation setting, you must be alert, active, and have your webcam on during the meeting.

### Reflection

*If you were to repeat this meeting, what would you do differently in the first 10 minutes?*
