# Week 9

## Following Up: Reflection and Growth

This week focuses on reflection and professional growth in consulting. During a follow-up consultation, you will encounter challenges that have emerged since your initial meeting. You will consider not only how earlier decisions shaped these outcomes, but also how your communication style and developing consulting identity influence how you respond to complexity, uncertainty, and client expectations.

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Identify how early research and design choices influence downstream analysis. 
2. Reflect on how your communication style and professional identity shape client interactions.
