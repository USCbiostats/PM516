PM516B: Biostatistical Consulting  
1 Unit  

## Course Overview
### Course Description
This course serves as an introduction to biostatistical consulting and is designed to help statisticians and data analysts develop the necessary skills for effective collaboration with non-statistician collaborators. Students will focus on two central goals: 1) developing the professional qualities required of an effective statistical consultant and 2) working with an investigator on an authentic analysis problem, including clarifying research questions, defining scope, conducting analyses, and communicating findings. 

Unlike purely role-play or methods-focused consulting courses, this course integrates real consultation experiences with structured reflection on professional responsibility, communication, and analytic judgment. Students engage in iterative consultations with real consequences, culminating in a professional final presentation to the investigator.

### Learning Objectives
Through this course, students will:

* Conduct an independent statistical consulting engagement from initial meeting through final report.
* Evaluate research questions by translating them into appropriate analytic strategies.
* Apply tools used from prior coursework to produce meaningful analyses
* Communicate effectively with non-statistician collaborators throughout the consulting process.
* Adapt to diverse research domains and collaborate professionally across disciplines.
* Prepare clear, comprehensive consulting reports suitable for dissemination, including manuscript-ready results.

### Course Preparation
Prerequisites: PM516a (this course assumes familiarity with basic statistics and regression analysis)

### Course Location
As a practicum-type course, work will be performed via online meetings.

## Course Requirements

### Communication
We will use USC e-mail for formal communication and Slack for informal collaborative communication.

### Textbook
There is no course textbook.

### Required Software
Students must have proficiency in at least one statistical program, but may choose which to use for this course (e.g., R, SAS, Stata, SPSS).

## Assessments

Students will each be assigned a project and will use the semester to perform statistical analyses and create an analysis report for the client collaborator. As a 1-unit course, students are expected to spend approximately 40 hours on the analysis and writing of the project. All work should be completed before the last day of class.

This course is graded credit/no credit and there is no point breakdown. Instead, students must complete <u>all</u> of the tasks located on the [timeline](content.md).

### Required Meetings 

Students should expect to schedule at least 5 meetings over the semester:

* Initial Meeting - Once the project is assigned, meet with the client (and instructor, if possible). After the meeting,  send the client and instructor a consultation follow-up e-mail that discusses the scope of work and appropriate timelines for the project.
* Interim Meetings. At least one interim meeting should be scheduled with the instructor and client collaborator to discuss statistical or substantive issues with the analysis, with additional meetings on an as-needed basis. 
* Final Meeting (Instructor). Before presenting the final analyses to the client, the student should schedule a meeting with the instructor to review the accuracy and interpretation of results to be presented in their analysis report.
* Final Meeting (Client). The final meeting will be focused on presenting the analyses to the client (and instructor should be included, if possible).

### Mock Invoice

Biostatistical work is typically performed on an hourly basis and staff must track their hours worked. Similar to how a consultant would submit an invoice of their work performed, you will record all hours worked on your project, including time spent writing your report, performing analyses, and in meeting with your client. (Do not record individual meetings with the instructor.)

### Analysis Report

Unlike PM516A, you will present your results in an analysis report. The report should be written in a way that is comprehensible by the client. You may use [this template](resources/analysis-report.md) that I like to use.

### Debriefing

After presenting the final analysis report, the client will be sent an evaluation form for constructive feedback on the student’s performance. Students should acknowledge the receipt of this feedback. This evaluation serves as feedback to the student but will not affect their final grade in the course.

### Grading Breakdown

The course is graded credit/no credit and there is no point breakdown. Instead, students must complete <u>all</u> of the tasks located on the [timeline](content.md). 

## Course-Specific Policies

### Participation and In-Class Work
Not only are students expected to be active and engaged during scheduled meetings, but engagement is paramount to being able to complete the project successfully.

### Assignment Submission
Students complete meetings and work at their own pace during the semester, but are responsible for meeting all deliverables by the dates set forth in the timeline.

### Course Norms

1. **Be A Good Representative** - This practicum is a real consulting engagement. Your work and conduct reflect not only on you, but also on our department's academic programs and relationships with investigators. Approach this experience with the seriousness, care, and integrity expected of a professional consultant.
2. **Engage As A Professional** - Professionalism includes punctuality, preparation, clear communication, and respectful collaboration. Schedule meetings responsibly, follow up in writing when appropriate, and seek instructor guidance when challenges arise. Consistent, thoughtful communication is essential to successful consulting.
3.	**Embrace Accountability** – Your investigator is investing time and trust in this collaboration. Follow through on commitments, document decisions and next steps, and maintain transparency about progress or obstacles. The quality of your engagement directly influences the success of the project.
4.	**Grow Through Independence** – This course is intentionally less structured than PM516A. You will not receive frequent reminders or rigid checkpoints. Managing timelines, anticipating obstacles, and maintaining momentum are part of the learning experience. Approximately 40 hours of effort are expected; plan accordingly. Independence in this practicum is an opportunity to develop professional discipline and ownership.

## Policy on the Use of AI Generators
In this course you will analyze third-party data. **Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) should never be used to perform analysis. There are serious confidentiality concerns associated with uploading data to these sites. Disciplinary action could/will result if used this way.**

However, the use of AI resources can sometimes be helpful when trying to reason through analytic approaches, solve coding challenges, etc. In my experience, though, the use of AI has led to incorrect, misleading, or otherwise false results in a surprising number of cases. As such, I discourage the use of AI as the “final arbiter” of advice related to data analysis. Keep in mind the following:

* I will state it again because it is important: never upload any investigator data to a generative AI resource.
* You may use AI tools to help aggregate and/or explain ideas related to this course, and some assignments will ask you to use these tools to generate hypothetical scenarios for you to examine.
* Only use these tools if you have sufficient training and experience in the methods you are asking AI tools to help you with. The output of such tools must be examined through a critical lens, and using such tools blindly can be dangerous.
* Be mindful of when AI is most useful. Consider its appropriateness in each situation.
* Do not assume the information provided by AI tools is accurate or trustworthy. In fact, assume all information is incorrect unless you can verify its accuracy with another source. You will be responsible for any errors or omissions provided by the tool.
* If you use AI tools for any deliverable, you are expected to clearly attribute any material generated by the tool used.

## Statement on Academic Conduct and Support Systems
### Academic Conduct
Plagiarism – presenting someone else’s ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words – is a serious academic offense with serious consequences. Please familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism in SCampus in Part B, Section 11, “Behavior Violating University Standards” https://policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b/. Other forms of academic dishonesty are equally unacceptable. See additional information in SCampus and university policies on scientific misconduct, http://policy.usc.edu/scientific-misconduct.
