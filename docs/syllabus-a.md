PM516A: Biostatistical Consulting  
1 Unit  
Monday 5:00-6:00pm

## Course Overview
### Course Description
This course serves as an introduction to biostatistical consulting, and will help statisticians and data analysts develop the necessary skills for successfully interacting with non-statistician collaborators. We will focus on two main goals: 1) developing qualities necessary for an effective statistical consultant and 2) working with an investigator on an actual analysis problem (determining research questions and scope, formulating and implementing our aalyses, and conveying our findings).

### Learning Objectives
Through this course, students will become familiar with the process of statistical consulting. Students will:

* Understand the importance of statistical consulting and its usefulness in the public health environment.
* Apply techniques to improve their understanding of an unfamiliar topic and translate researchers' questions into a statistically testable set of hypotheses.
* Evaluate the best statistical approaches to address collaborators' questions and apply such techniques.
* Apply effective communication by clearly explaining statistical concepts.
* Understand ethical considerations faced by statisticians.
* Create analyses and results for dissemination to the client and other stakeholders.

### Course Preparation
Prerequisites: PM510 or equivalent course  (this course assumes familiarity with basic statistics and regression analysis)

### Course Location
We have a reserved room for this course. However, due to the nature of statistical consulting with remote clients, a substantial component of the course will be held online. Please check course announcements for further information about our meeting location.

## Course Requirements

### Communication
All course materials will be available through this website. We will use USC e-mail for formal communication and Slack for informal collaborative communication. Because the class covers aspects of consulting, including face-to-face interactions, <u>please practice having your webcam on during class.</u>

### Textbook
Cabrera J, McDougall A. Statistical Consulting. Springer Science & Business Media; 2002 Jan 2. (Textbook may be available through the USC libraries at libraries.usc.edu)

### Required Software
Students must have proficiency in at least one statistical program, but may choose which to use for this course (e.g., R, SAS, Stata, SPSS).

## Assessments

There are three broad categories of activites for this course:

* Skills development for consultants, which will prepare the student to interact with a client and improve the quality of their consultations.
* Skills development for presenting statistical results, which will improve the effectiveness of the statistician being able to communicate results to their client.
* Participation in a real consultation as a group with an investigator client at USC.

This course is graded credit/no credit and there is no point breakdown. Instead, students must complete <u>all</u> of the following:

#### Weekly Activities
Students will participate in weekly activities to improve their consulting and statistical analysis skills. In order to benefit from these activities, students must complete required pre-class preparation, which may include reading articles, excerpts from the textbook, or watching videos. Students will use the information from these pre-class preparation activities in the live session.

#### Investigator Meeting
Students will be meeting with a collaborator at USC (e.g., from Keck School of Medicine, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, etc.) and will work on a project as a group. Any meeting with the investigator is mandatory. Because this course teaches skills applicable in a consulting setting, students must be on time for the meeting and must be an <u>alert, active participant</u> with their <u>camera on</u>.

#### Final Presentation
The final day of class will involve a presentation to the client collaborator. Students will present in groups, and each student must contribute to the presentation. At the end of the meeting, there will be a brief period for the students and client to provide feedback on the experience.

## Grading Breakdown

| **Assignment** | Criteria |
| :-: | :-- |
|Weekly Activities | Actively participate in at least 10 sessions. Half-credit will be given if the student attends but does not actively participate. Students may make up for a missed class session via a written assignment. |
|Investigator Meeting | Actively participate in the preliminary investigator meeting. |
|Final Presentation | Substantially contribute to the final project, including presenting part of the final group presentation. |

## Classroom Norms
1. **Take Charge of Your Learning** - As a graduate-level course, this is an opportunity to deepen your expertise and develop new skills in your academic field. Your success depends on active engagement and responsibility in the learning process. Feel empowered to ask questions, seek clarification, and communicate barriers early with the instructor. Make use of all resources available to you, including office hours, peer support, and additional readings.
2.	**Be Present** – This is a practice-based course, and active participation is key to your success as a consultant. “Being present” means not just physically attending class sessions, but fully engaging in every class session through focus, contribution to discussions, and participation in activities. Your active involvement during class time will deepen your understanding of the field and help you develop useful skills.
3.	**Practice Professionalism** – In this course, you will engage with your fellow students, but also external collaborators who are professionals in the field. It is essential to conduct yourself with professionalism in all interactions with them and with your fellow classmates. This includes being punctual, communicating clearly and respectfully, and representing you and your program with integrity. Come to sessions prepared, showing respect for the time and expertise of others. The way you conduct yourself in these interactions will contribute to your growth and future success in the field.

## Policy on the Use of AI Generators
In this course you will analyze third-party data. **Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) should never be used to perform analysis. There are serious confidentiality concerns associated with uploading data to these sites. Disciplinary action could/will result if used this way.**

However, the use of AI resources can sometimes be helpful when trying to reason through analytic approaches, solve coding challenges, etc. In my experience, though, the use of AI has led to incorrect, misleading, or otherwise false results in a surprising number of cases. As such, I discourage the use of AI as the “final arbiter” of advice related to data analysis. Keep in mind the following:

* I will state it again because it is important: never upload any investigator data to a generative AI resource.
* You may use AI tools to help aggregate and/or explain ideas related to this course, and some assignments will ask you to use these tools to generate hypothetical scenarios for you to examine.
* Only use these tools if you have sufficient training and experience in the methods you are asking AI tools to help you with. The output of such tools must be examined through a critical lens, and using such tools blindly can be dangerous.
* Be mindful of when AI is most useful. Consider its appropriateness in each situation.
* Do not assume the information provided by AI tools is accurate or trustworthy. In fact, assume all information is incorrect unless you can verify its accuracy with another source. You will be responsible for any errors or omissions provided by the tool.
* If you use AI tools for any deliverable, you are expected to clearly attribute any material generated by the tool used.
