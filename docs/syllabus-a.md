PM516A: Statistical Problem Solving  
1 Unit  
Monday 5:10-6:00pm
ONLINE 

## Course Overview
### Course Description
This course serves as an introduction to biostatistical consulting, and will help statisticians and data analysts develop the necessary skills for successfully interacting with non-statistician collaborators. We will focus on two main goals: 1) developing qualities necessary for an effective statistical consultant and 2) working with an investigator on an actual analysis problem (determining research questions and scope, formulaating and implementing our aalyses, and conveying our findings).

### Learning Objectives
Through this course, students will become familiar with the process of statistical consulting. Students will learn:  

* To explain the importance of statistical consulting and its usefulness in the public health environment
* How to improve their understanding of an unfamiliar topic and translate researchers' questions into a statistically testable set of hypotheses
* To choose the best statistical approach for answering a collaborator's questions
* Ways of communicating effectively by clearly explaining statistical concepts
* To understand ethical considerations for statisticians
* To appropriately analyze and interpret analyses for dissemination materials, such as brief reports or results sections of manuscripts

### Course Preparation
Prerequisites: PM510 or equivalent course  (this course assumes familiarity with basic statistics and regression analysis)

### Description of Assessments
**Pre-Class Activities** should be completed before class meets as we will discuss this content during class and/or the content is necessary for understanding the in-class materials. This may include readings, videos, or analyses.  
**In-Class Activities** will focus on developing skills for statistical consultations (e.g., client-consultant role-playing, group discussion, interacting with an investigator, presenting results, etc.) or other discussion-type questions.   
**The Final Project** will take the form of a presentation to address the researcher's question from the consultation. In PM516a you will develop a presentation within groups and present it on the last day of class. In PM516b you will complete an analysis report and present it on the last day of class.  

Please upload one document containing the responses to all of the week's questions by midnight on the day class meets.
