PM516A: Statistical Problem Solving  
1 Unit  
Monday 5:10-6:00pm
SSB115 

## Course Overview
### Course Description
This course serves as an introduction to biostatistical consulting, and will help statisticians and data analysts develop the necessary skills for successfully interacting with non-statistician collaborators. We will focus on two main goals: 1) developing qualities necessary for an effective statistical consultant and 2) working with an investigator on an actual analysis problem (determining research questions and scope, formulating and implementing our aalyses, and conveying our findings).

### Learning Objectives
Through this course, students will become familiar with the process of statistical consulting. Students will:

* Understand the importance of statistical consulting and its usefulness in the public health environment.
* Apply techniques to improve their understanding of an unfamiliar topic and translate researchers' questions into a statistically testable set of hypotheses.
* Evaluate the best statistical approaches to address collaborators' questions and apply such techniques.
* Apply effective communication by clearly explaining statistical concepts.
* Understand ethical considerations faced by statisticians.
* Create analyses and results for dissemination to the client and other stakeholders.

### Course Preparation
Prerequisites: PM510 or equivalent course  (this course assumes familiarity with basic statistics and regression analysis)

### Course Location
We have a reserved room for this course. However, due to the nature of statistical consulting with remote clients, a substantial component of the course will be held online. Please check course announcements for further information about our meeting location.

## Course Requirements

### Communication
All course materials will be available through this website. We will use USC e-mail for formal communication and Slack for informal collaborative communication. Because the class covers aspects of consulting, including face-to-face interactions, <u>please practice having your webcam on during class.</u>

### Textbook
Cabrera J, McDougall A. Statistical Consulting. Springer Science & Business Media; 2002 Jan 2. (Textbook may be available through the USC libraries at libraries.usc.edu)

### Required Software
Students must have proficiency in at least one statistical program, but may choose which to use for this course (e.g., R, SAS, Stata, SPSS).

## Assessments

There are three broad categories of activites for this course:

* Skills development for consultants, which will prepare the student to interact with a client and improve the quality of their consultations.
* Skills development for presenting statistical results, which will improve the effectiveness of the statistician being able to communicate results to their client.
* Participation in a real consultation as a group with an investigator client at USC.

This course is graded credit/no credit and there is no point breakdown. Instead, student must complete <u>all</u> of the following:

#### Required Trainings
Students will be working with real data from investigators at USC and must complete the appropriate required trainings. There are two trainings offered by CITI (https://about.citiprogram.org/) that must be completed by the third week of class: 

* CITI Biomedical Human Subjects
* CITI Responsible Conduct of Research
* Students may need to complete additional project-specific trainings

#### Weekly Activities
Students will participate in weekly activities to improve their consulting and statistical analysis skills. In order to get the most of these activities, students must complete required pre-class preparation, which may include reading articles, excerpts from the textbook, or watching videos. Students will use the information from these pre-class preparation activities in the live session, and will receive credit if they actively participate in at least 10 sessions. Partial credit will be given if the student attends but does not actively participate in a live class session.

#### Investigator Meeting
Students will be meeting with a collaborator at USC (e.g., from Keck School of Medicine, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, etc.) and will work on a project as a group. Any meeting with the investigator is mandatory. Because this course teaches skills applicable in a consulting setting, students must be on time for the meeting and must be an <u>alert, active participant</u> with their <u>camera on</u>.

#### Final Presentation
The final day of class will be a presentation to the client collaborator. Students will present in groups, and each student must contribute to the presentation. At the end of the meeting, there will be a brief period for the students and client to provide feedback on the experience.

### Late Submission Policy
Assignments cannot be completed outside of the in-class context. However, there may be opportunities for alternate make-up assignments in rare circumstances.
