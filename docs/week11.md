# Week 11

##  From Analysis to Manuscript

This week focuses on the professional responsibilities of the statistician in research reporting. Beyond conducting analyses, statisticians must determine which results are essential, how they should be communicated, and which reporting standards apply. We will discuss how to prioritize findings and clarify the statistician’s role in the final product.

By the end of this week you will be able to:
1. Distinguish between analyses that are essential for reporting and those that are primarily exploratory or internal.
2. Identify the statistician’s responsibilities in adhering to standardized reporting guidelines.

### Before Class

#### Project Progress

👥 Meet with your group and make progress on the following questions about your project:

Not every analysis belongs in the final report — some serve to strengthen internal understanding rather than inform the investigator. Consider all analyses you have performed up to this point. Write a list of what the analysis was, why you did it, and classify each into the following categories: 

* A. Analysis that is essential for the investigator to know and directly addresses the research question. 
* B. Analysis that may be important for the investigator to know, but you would not necessarily include it in a manuscript (think: is it one of the top 5-10 analyses that you have or will perform?) 
* C. Analysis that is important to you (the statistician) ONLY, and is not relevant for the investigator. 

Use this table as a guide:  

| Analysis | Rationale | Importance |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
|Examined patterns of missingness across all variables | Ensures large enough sample size and that analyses are not biased | B |

#### Manuscript Checklists

📖 [STROBE Checklist for Observational Studies](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/) (3 minutes)
 
📖 [CONSORT Checklist for Randomized Trials](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/) (3 minutes)

&#x27A4; Based on the study design, would you use the CONSORT or STROBE checklist for this study? <br />
&#x27A4; As a statistician, which of the items on the checklist will you be responsible for? <br />
&#x27A4; Identify which checklist items are most relevant to your project and ensure they are addressed in your final report.

### In Class

In week's class we will discuss the statistician’s role in shaping the final report and how to prioritize findings for presentation. We will additionally discuss how to prioritize the information presented to the investigator. 

### Reflection

*What is the difference between an analysis that reassures the statistician and one that informs the investigator?*
