# Week 11

##  The Statistician's Role / Check-In II

&#x27A4; This week we will check-in and discuss the role of the statistician in a broader research project.

### Before Class

#### Manuscript Checklists

📖 [STROBE Checklist for Observational Studies](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/)<br /> 
 
📖 [CONSORT Checklist for Randomized Trials](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/) 

1. Based on the study design, would you use the CONSORT or STROBE checklist for this study?
1. As a statistician, which of the items on the checklist will you be responsible for?
1. Verify that all these items are addressed in your final report.

#### Critical Review

📝 Consider every analysis that you have performed up to this point. Write a list of what the analysis was, why you did it, and classify each into the following categories: 

* A. Analysis that is essential for the investigator to know and directly addresses the research question. 
* B. Analysis that may be important for the investigator to know, but you would not necessarily include it in a manuscript (think: is it one of the top 5-10 analyses that you have or will perform?) 
* C. Analysis that is important to you (the statistician) ONLY, and is not relevant for the investigator. 

Use this table as a guide:  

| Analysis | Rationale | Importance |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
|Examined patterns of missingness across all variables | Ensures large enough sample size and that analyses are not biased | B |

#### Group Meeting

👥 Meet with your group and create a draft of your presentation.
