# Week 10

##  The Statistician's Role

&#x27A4; This week we will discuss the role of the statistician in a broader research project.

### Before Class

#### Brief Check-In

ðŸ‘¥ Meet with your group and be prepared to answer the following questions about your project:

* What is the research question that your investigator/client wants to answer?
* What is the analytic sample size?
* What are the exposures of interest?
* What are the outcomes of interest?
* Are there any stratification variables / effect modifiers?
* What are the distributions of each of the variables that will be used? Are the distributions skewed and/or are there any outliers?
* What statistical tests did you perform in order to analyze the data?
* What are the results of those statistical tests?

#### Manuscript Checklists

ðŸ“– [STROBE Checklist for Observational Studies](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/)<br /> 
 
ðŸ“– [CONSORT Checklist for Randomized Trials](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/) 

1. Based on the study design, would you use the CONSORT or STROBE checklist for this study?
1. As a statistician, which of the items on the checklist will you be responsible for?
1. Verify that all these items are addressed in your final report.
