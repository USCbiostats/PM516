# Week 12

##  Ethical Responsibility in Statistical Practice

This week focuses on ethical responsibility in statistical consulting. Beyond technical correctness, statisticians must navigate pressures related to study design, reporting, media interpretation, authorship, and conflicts of interest. Through case examination, we will consider how to respond when professional judgment intersects with ethical responsibility.

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
1. Identify ethical risks that arise in statistical consulting and research reporting.
2. Articulate a professional response to ethically challenging situations.
