# Week 13

##  Project Check-In

&#x27A4; This week we will review the project presentation and any additional analyses that need to be performed.

### Before Class

#### Group Meeting

1. Meet with your group and create a draft of your presentation.

#### Critical Review

2. Consider every analysis that you have performed up to this point. Write a list of what the analysis was, why you did it, and classify each into the following categories: <br />

A. Analysis that is essential for the investigator to know and directly addresses the research question. <br />
B. Analysis that may be important for the investigator to know, but you would not necessarily include it in a manuscript (think: is it one of the top 5-10 analyses that you have or will perform?) <br />
C. Analysis that is important to you (the statistician) ONLY, and is not relevant for the investigator. <br />

Use this table as a guide:  

| Analysis | Rationale | Importance |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
|Examined patterns of missingness across all variables | Ensures large enough sample size and that analyses are not biased | B |
