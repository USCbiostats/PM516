### Complete Before Class

#### Project

ðŸ‘¥ Meet with your group to finalize your presentation. As a reminder, here are the following guidelines:

1. You will have 30 minutes with your investigator. Plan for a 10-15 minute presentation with extra time for questions and answers at the end.
2. Make sure you answer all your investigator's questions. It may help organize your thoughts to have a list of the research questions and then a brief response to each question stating the answer to that question based on your analysis.
3. Each team member must contribute to the presentation to some extent.
4. Be on time to the presentation, alert, and with your webcam on during the meeting.

That's it - congratulations!
