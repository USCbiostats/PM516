# Week 4

## Practice Consultations

&#x27A4; This week we will practice consulting via roleplaying exercises.  
&#x27A4; We will also review some techniques that will help you improve the quality of your consultation.

### Before Class

ðŸ“– Textbook Chapter 4.1 - 4.4

1. What are some tools you can use to help you organize your thoughts during a consulting session and remember what was discussed? 

ðŸ“– [What Is Your Research Question? An Introduction to the PICOT Format for Clinicians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3430448/)<br />  

1. Use [chat GPT](chatgpt.com) to generate a hypothetical statistical consulting scenario. Ask the following questions:
     * What is the population of interest for this study?
     * Are there any exclusion and/or inclusion criteria?
     * Is there any issue with generalizability?
     * What is the intervention/treatment group?
     * What is the comparison/control group?
     * What is the outcome of this study?
     * Is time an important component?
  
2. What else would you want to know about the research question? Think about general information about the study, the variables being used, and the target population.
3. Do you have an idea of a type of analysis you could perform? What additional information do you think you might need from the client?


### In Class
