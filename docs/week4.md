## Investigator Meeting

&#x27A4; This week we will meet with the investigator to discuss the project.  
&#x27A4; In preparation, we will learn the PICOT framework for clinical research questions. 

### Before Class

ðŸ“– [What Is Your Research Question? An Introduction to the PICOT Format for Clinicians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3430448/)<br />  

1. For each of the PICOT categories, explain whether the information is clear based on the intake form or if you will need to follow up during the meeting:
     * The population of interest for this study?
     * Any exclusion and/or inclusion criteria?
     * Any issue with generalizability?
     * The intervention/treatment group?
     * The comparison/control group?
     * The outcome of this study?
     * If time is an important component?
  
2. What else would you want to know about the research question? Think about general information about the study, the variables being used, and the target population.
3. Do you have an idea of a type of analysis you could perform? What additional information do you think you might need from the client?
4. Is it clear what the investigatorâ€™s goal for this study is (e.g., an abstract submission, a manuscript, etc.)? Do you know the deadlines the client has?
5. List 2- 3 questions you think will be important to ask the investigator.
