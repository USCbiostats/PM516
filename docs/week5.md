#### Exploratory Data Analysis

📖 [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html)

1.  Write a list of the research questions your investigator had. For each item on the list, what are the variables that will be needed to address the question?
2. Comment on whether the data is in a format that is acceptable for analysis. Check variable names, variable types, and values within variables. Is the data set free of any extraneous information (e.g., notes, color formatting)?
3. Comment on the distributions of the variables you will use, providing measures of variation and central tendency. Comment on outliers.
3. Comment on any missingness in your variables. If present, how extensive is any missingness? Are missing values clearly denoted?
4. Provide information on the relationships among all relevant variables in the form of correlation matrices, scatter plots, and contingency tables, where appropriate. 
5. Draft a table and a figure that you think illustrates an important preliminary descriptive finding.


#### Research Design and Statistical Hypotheses
📖 [Choosing the Right Statistical Test](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.5694/mja17.00422)

6. Write out the investigator's research questions in the form of testable statistical hypotheses.
7. Which type(s) of tests will you use to test these hypotheses?
