## PM516A - Tables & Figures

&#x27A4; We will not meet live due to **PhD Screening Exam**.  
&#x27A4; This week we will look at ways to improve our tables and figures.


### Complete Outside of Class

#### Improving Graphs & Figures

📖 [How to Graph Badly or What Not To Do](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jpboyd/sciviz_1_graphbadly.pdf)

1. Section 1.3 of “How To Graph Badly” lists “Wainer’s Rules for Bad Graphs.” Last week you made a graph of the data. Do any of these rules apply to your graph? If they do, fix it.

📖 [Rudiments of Numeracy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2344922)

2. “Rudiments of Numeracy” lists six rules to follow when producing graphs and tables. Rule 6 concerns whether to produce a graph vs. a table. Consider the graphs and tables you produced. Which of them are better left as-is, and which should be converted from a graph to a table or vice versa?
  
#### Analysis

3. Continue to perform analyses for your project, including all statistical tests you believe to be necessary.
4. Decide how you want to present the results of these statistical tests. For each analysis, would it be best displayed through text, a graph, or a figure?

### Optional Readings

## PM516B - Personality Types

&#x27A4; This week we will learn a little more about personality types. Knowing our own personality type and that of others can help us to have more productive collaborations with investigators.

### Complete Outside of Class

#### Personality Types

📖 [Myers-Briggs Personality Test](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test)

1. What personality type were you? 
2. What aspects of the results make sense to you, and what aspects were you surprised by?

📖 [How Each Personality Type Likes to Communicate](https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/how-each-myers-briggs-personality-type-likes-to-communicate/)

3. Do you think that the tips provided for your personality type in the “How Each Personality Type Likes to Communicate” document are correct? Is there anything you would add to the information they present?
4. Think of an individual (e.g., supervisor, mentor, teacher, maybe the investigator for the class project) that you have worked with in the past. What personality type do you think they are? How would knowing their personality type change how you might approach interacting with them?
5. Make progress on the Statistical Methods and Results sections of your analysis report.

#### Analysis

6. Continue to perform analyses for your project, including all statistical tests you believe to be necessary.
7. Decide how you want to present the results of these statistical tests. For each analysis, would it be best displayed through text, a graph, or a figure?
