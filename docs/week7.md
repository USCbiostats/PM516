## PM516A - Critical Review

&#x27A4; We will not meet live due to **Independence Day**.  
&#x27A4; This week we will review the project thus far and determine which information is necessary for you to know vs. for the client to know.

#### Group Meeting

üìñ [Statistical Data Presentation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28580077/)

1. Meet with your group and create a draft of your presentation.

#### Critical Review

2. Consider every analysis that you have performed up to this point. Write a list of what the analysis was, why you did it, and classify each into the following categories: <br />

A. Analysis that is important to you (the statistician) ONLY, and is not relevant for the investigator. <br />
B. Analysis that may be important for the investigator to know, but you would not necessarily include it in a manuscript (think: is it one of the top 5-10 analyses that you have or will perform?) <br />
C. Analysis that is essential for the investigator to know and directly addresses the research question. <br />

Use this table as a guide:  

| Analysis | Rationale | Importance |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
|Examined patterns of missingness across all variables | Ensures large enough sample size and that analyses are not biased | B |


## PM516B - Statistical Mistakes

&#x27A4; This week we will critically evaluate our analyses for statistical mistakes.

üìñ [Ten Common Statistical Mistakes to Watch Out For When Writing or Reviewing A Manuscript](https://elifesciences.org/articles/48175) <br />

*Go through each of the common statistical mistakes and evaluate whether any of them apply to your project and analysis.*

* Adequate control condition/group.   
  + Does the study have a control condition or group? If not, explain why this is not necessary.
  + Is the control group adequately powered to detect a difference from the treatment group?
  + Are any biases introduced as a result of the assignment to control vs. treatment condition?
  
* Direct comparisons between two effects.   
  + When comparing groups, is just one statistical test used?
  + Which statistical tests are used for the main conclusions in the study?

* Inflating the units of analysis.   
  + What are the observational units on which the analysis was performed?
  + What are the statistical tests actually testing?
  + Are there any ‚Äúclustering‚Äù variables?
  
* Spurious correlations.   
  + Were all variables checked for outliers?
  + Were all analyses examined for possible effect modification?
  + What visual methods were performed in addition to statistical tests?
  
* Use of small samples.   
  + Is the sample size large enough for you to be confident in your conclusions (honestly)?
  + Have you included confidence intervals in addition to point estimates?
  
* Circular analysis.   
  + What analytical decision rules did you make after performing preliminary analyses?
  + How was the selection criteria biased in favor of the hypothesis being tested?
  
* p-hacking.   
  + Do you believe that your study is more exploratory or confirmatory?
  + Did the outcome of interest change during the analysis?
  
* Multiple comparisons.   
  + How many different associations were examined during your analysis?
  + Would you trust your methods if you were reviewing this paper?
  
* Over-interpreting non-significant results.   
  + Was there any point in which a non-significant result was interpreted as a lack of an effect?
  + Are effect sizes reported along with p-values?
  
* Correlation and causation.   
  + Were any conclusions made with regard to causality? What were these and do they make sense?
  + Would it make sense if the outcome of the study actually caused the independent variable?
