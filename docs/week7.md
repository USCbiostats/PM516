# Week 7

## Communicating Statistical Concepts

&#x27A4; This week we will learn techniques to effectively communicate results of your statistical analysis.

### Before Class

#### Project Progress

ðŸ‘¥ Meet with your group and be prepared to answer the following questions about your project:

* Comment on whether your data was in a format that is acceptable for analysis. Check variable names, variable types, and values within variables. Is the data set free of any extraneous information (e.g., notes, color formatting)? How many observations are there?
* Comment on the distributions of the variables you will use, providing measures of variation and central tendency. Comment on outliers.
* Comment on any missingness in your variables. If present, how extensive is any missingness? Are missing values clearly denoted?

#### Communicating Results

ðŸ“– [The Adept Method](https://betterexplained.com/articles/adept-method/) (8 minutes)

1. Ask [chat GPT](chatgpt.com) to explain a biostatistical concept using the ADEPT method. What concept did it choose? How well do you think its explanations were? 
2. Post a brief synopsis to the course Slack (no more than a couple sentences) of the concept that was chosen and the analogy that was made.

ðŸ“– [Twenty Five Analogies for Explaining Statistical Concepts](http://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/AMSTAT/91c6ce4e-3d37-41fd-bff5-a8027e914f3b/UploadedImages/Twenty-Five_Analogies_for_Explainging_Statistical_Concepts.pdf) (19 minutes)<br />  

1. Which of the analogies did you feel was most effective? Why?

ðŸ“– [Communicating Statistics to Nonstatisticians](https://stattrak.amstat.org/2016/08/01/nonstatisticians/) (10 minutes)<br /> 

1. Which method of communication does the author say has the greatest chance of success?

### In Class

In this week's class, we will discuss the ADEPT method, statistical analogies, and review how to respond to an investigator that needs clarifying information.

### Reflection

*Which aspect of this week's content do you feel was most beneficial? Did you learn new information, such as an analogy, mindset, or specific approach toward interacting with clients?*
