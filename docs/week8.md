# Week 8

## Analysis Check-In

&#x27A4; This week we will reflect on the analyes that have, and will be, performed.  

### Before Class

#### Project Progress

ðŸ‘¥ Meet with your group and compile a <u>project draft</u>. There should just be one document per group. You may e-mail it or send via Slack. It should include the following:

##### Background and Scope

* Clearly outline the research questions posed by your investigator.
* For each question, specify the key variables from the dataset that will be used to address it.
* If applicable, briefly describe the study design and/or data source, to contextualize how the questions can be answered.

##### Data and Design

* Summarize the unit of observation (e.g., participant, procedure, visit, time period) and the total number of observations available.
* Describe the extent of missing data and any preliminary strategies for handling it (e.g., listwise deletion, pairwise deletion, imputation, sensitivity analysis).
* Discuss variables of concern (e.g., input errors, unclear coding) and note any data cleaning steps performed.
* Present summary statistics that describe the main variables (tables or figures), emphasizing their distributions.
* Include simple bivariate analyses that explore the relationships between key variables (e.g., means by group, correlations, contingency tables).

##### Analysis Plan
 
* For each research question, state the planned statistical approach.
* Specify the null and alternative hypothesis for each test, with regard to your model parameters.

#### Research Design and Statistical Hypotheses

### In Class

This week's class will be a workshop session to address any questions you may have about the project.

### Reflection

*How do you feel the consulting work is going so far? What has been the most difficult aspect of this work?*
