# Week 9

## Practice Consultations II

&#x27A4; This week we will perform some more complex role-playing exercises. In advance of the session, we will explore personality types and learn about developing a statistical consulting "brand."

### Before Class

#### Marketing your Business

üìñ [Statistical Consulting Clients: How to Get and Keep Them](https://stattrak.amstat.org/2022/02/01/statistical-consulting/) (5 minutes)<br />

1. Do you currently have access to networking resources you could use to start a business? If so, what are these? If not, how could you go about creating connections that could help you?

#### Qualities for Statistical Consultants

üìñ [What to Expect When You Consult A Statistician](https://community.amstat.org/cnsl/forclients/expect-content) (20 minutes)<br />
Pay attention to the 11 qualities listed in Section 1.D. (What to look for in a statistical consultant).  

3. Which quality do you identify with most? Which do you identify with least? 
5. How do you think you can improve the qualities you are less comfortable with?

#### Personality TYpes

üìñ [Myers-Briggs Personality Test](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test)

1. What personality type were you? 
2. What aspects of the results make sense to you, and what aspects were you surprised by?

üìñ [How Each Personality Type Likes to Communicate](https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/how-each-myers-briggs-personality-type-likes-to-communicate/)

3. Do you think that the tips provided for your personality type in the ‚ÄúHow Each Personality Type Likes to Communicate‚Äù document are correct? Is there anything you would add to the information they present?

#### Brand Synthesis

Tell ChatGPT the following things:

  * The top qualities you listed.
  * Your Myers-Briggs personality type.
  * How your personality type likes to communicate.
  * Ask it to create a "brand" for you.
  
Based on these responses, come up with your "brand." Post in Slack a brief description of your brand, a slogan, and another piece of information about it.

### In Class

In week's class we will have more practice consultations.

### Reflection

*Think of the person with whom you consulted today. How would knowing their personality type change how you might approach interacting with them?*
