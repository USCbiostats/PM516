# Week 9

## Practice Consultations II

&#x27A4; This week we will perform some more complex role-playing exercises.

&#x27A4; We will also learn about developing a statistical consulting "brand."

&#x27A4; There is an optional section on personality types. Knowing our own personality type and that of others can help us to have more productive collaborations with investigators.
